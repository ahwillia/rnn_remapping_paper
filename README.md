Code associated with Low et al., 2023 (*eLife* and *[biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.25.525596v3)*): **Remapping in a recurrent neural network model of navigation and context inference**.

To train your own RNN models, use the scripts found in the `model_scripts` folder.

In the `data` folder, you can find the models used throughout the paper (`saved_models`) as well as a sample subset of the neural data used for fig. 6 (`subset_neural_data`).

The code to run the analysis and produce the figure panels associated with each figure can be found in the corresponding folders.
